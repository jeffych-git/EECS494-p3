Initial Issues:
    Cards had low mana costs, and the mana bar filled quickly.
    Players had low health, allowing for rapid card use and very short gameplay.
    Game generally lacked visual appeal as characters were static.

Solutions:
    Increased player health.
    Added new card types to extend gameplay and enhance strategy:
        Attack cards: Deal instant damage.
        Block cards: Temporarily block incoming damage.
        Bow cards: Shoot an arrow that damages on impact.
        Heal cards: Restore player health.
        Heavy attack cards: Charge, then deal damage.
        Shield cards: Provide a shield around the player.

Visual Improvements:
    Added idle animations for characters in battle.
    Added animations for different card actions.
